Over the past few years, the increasing security demand has attract a growing attention toward biometrical authentication based on voice, iris, fingerprint, palm print, face, etc. Among them, face recognition represents one of the more interesting modalities. Due to its low intrusiveness and to the possibility of completing the process of authentication in a hands-free way, as well for the constant decrease in image acquisition cost, it appears particularly suitable for a wide number of real time applications, such as surveillance, security systems, access control, etc. On the other hand it presents many problems resulting from face localization inside an image to pose, illumination, expression variations other than to the natural face variation with time and age. Much work has been done in recent years in this field and many different approaches have been proposed for face recognition [1]. In general they can be divided in two main categories: holistic approach which considers the image as an high dimensional vector, where each pixel is mapped to a component of a vector, and geometry-feature-based methods that try to identify the position and relationship between face parts, like eyes, nose and mouth and the extracted parameters that are measures of distance, shape, size of these regions. Obviously the choice of the method used for the face recognition problem is strictly correlated with the kind of application to which it is intended. Furthermore the biometric recognition can be divided in two different approaches: identification, in which the model of the person that has to be recognized is compared with the models of all the individuals in the database in order to obtain his identity, and verification, in which the user declares his identity to the system, so the model of the person is compared with his model in the database, according to the distance between the models, the system decide if accept or refuse the user. Often the best performing system in identification is not also the best performing system in verification
